# StudentScorePredictionML
This is a simple ML model that predicts the scores of the students based on a simple dataset using Linear Regression.
It imports the data from a remote link.
Seperates the data into X and y where X is the data and y is teh result.
The data is split into Training and Testing data in a 80-20 split.
There are graphs of the data before and after the regressor is trained and with the regressor line.
The data is fit into the model and it is predicted and verified against the test data.
The model is analysed using MSE or Mean Squared Error method and MAE Mean Absolute Error.
We then Predict the Score based on our Custom input.
